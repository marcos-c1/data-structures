# Data-Structures

All the data structures implementation in C.

# Why should we know how to implement them?

Data structures are abstract types of data that will be needed to perform operations on a large amount of data, that is, to store, fetch and delete information in an application, it is necessary to wrap it in a structure that can have an index that points to the specific data, for example.

# Motivation

My goal with this project is to learn how to implement them in the best way possible, using concepts of clean code and refactoring. There will be a lot of changes throughout the creation, and this is the fun part of the project.

# Commands

Make sure to have the make tool installed on your system and them use the "make run" command to compile the code objects and the main file which will be generated.
